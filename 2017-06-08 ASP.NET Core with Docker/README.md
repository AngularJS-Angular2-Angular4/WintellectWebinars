# ASP.NET Core with Docker

ASP.NET Core offers the exciting ability to develop, test, and deploy on different platforms. In this webinar, we look at how to use Docker to create a consistent testing and deployment target for ASP.NET Core applications. We also talk about deployment to Microsoft Azure and AWS.

## Prerequisites

To perform the demonstrations as shown during the webinar, you must have the Docker tools installed for your platform (the Community Edition is fine). You can find a download for each supported platform here: https://www.docker.com/get-docker

## Demos

Some of the demos involve a series of commands issued at the command line. For your convenience, these commands are provided in the Demos directory.
